# Phase Summaries

This directory contains phase summaries for the MQTT comparison project.
Summaries are written in FIFO order as the project progresses through each phase.

## Phase Order

1. Bootstrap - Core infrastructure setup
2. Python - Python implementation with JSON and MsgPack
3. Rust - Rust implementation with JSON and MsgPack
4. C/C++ - C and C++ implementations with JSON and MsgPack
5. Julia/R/C# - Julia, R, and C# implementations
6. CBOR/Proto - Add CBOR and Protobuf support across languages
7. Unified Benchmarks - Complete benchmark harness and analysis

Use `summarize_phase.py` to generate summaries after completing each phase.
